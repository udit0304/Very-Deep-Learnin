Model is overfitting when training accuracy is much higher than validation accuracy. Some of the techniques to overcome overfitting are:
1. Regularization.
2. Batch Normalization.
3. Dropout
4. Transfer Learning.

In our case, adding more convolutional layers to model have to not caused over fitting. However, transfer learning resulted in much better accuracy:

1. Results of Transfer Learning (for 50 epochs):



Training Acc@1: 90.000%

Validation Acc@1:84.00%

2. Results of Normal Approach(for 150 epochs):

Training  Acc@1 = 80.00%
Validation Acc@1: 74.000%
